## About Me
My background in critical care has given me a strong foundation in clinical assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and health data interpretation. I complement this with technical skills in data cleaning, visualization, and predictive analytics.
I bring strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, with experience in healthcare metrics, statistical modeling, and data storytelling to support decision-making and policy planning. I enjoy bridging clinical insight with technical analytics to create meaningful health outcomes. If you have an idea, let’s work together-let’s build something fun and interesting with data!
